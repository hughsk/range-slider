[view example](http://hughsk.io/range-slider)

## Usage

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/range-slider.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/range-slider/)

This module expects a "wrapper" element, and creates the slidable part on the
inside, which will take up the full size of its parent. Note that if the parent
doesn't have `position: relative|fixed|absolute` set, this will be set to
`relative` on your behalf.

### inner = range(slide, [inital], update)

Returns the slider's inside DOM element, where `slide` is a parent element that
you've already created.

`initial` is an optional value between 0 and 1 for determining where to start
the slider. `update(value)` is a function that's called every time the slider's
value changes â€“ the value will always be a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is
the left side of the slider and 1 is the right.
